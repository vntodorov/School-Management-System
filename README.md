## üìù Full Description
<b>iStudent</b> will play the role of a school data management system and will allow you to perform everything for a successful supervision. <br>

A basic managment system for a virtual school - you can build, organize and control a computer-generated educational institution. You take the role of the administrator and have the rights to do everything this system has to offer. The app is designed to operate as a school organization control to add and manage student data, as well as request a certain information from the DB by the user - administrator. You can use the school management software to manage your school's daily administrative and academic operations. The main key features are: <br>

The main focus and priority of <b>iStudent</b> are the students and their manageable data. Schools accept hundreds of new students every year, that's why you can easily add a new student in your virtual school. The school <i>admin</i> can gain access to admission details and personal information of students like their full name, age, town, current school marks, clubs and even their parents (if present). <br>

When a new teacher starts lecturing in your school - simply add them with the desired <b>subject</b>, simple as that. There are also other employees who work in a school, every in different <b>department</b> - they are covered in <b>iStudent</b> too. <br>

That's why <b>iStudent</b> manages clubs too. They aim to help students further explore an academic area by communicating with fellow students. These student organisations might also be just a nice distraction from all school obligations - every <i>student</i> has the right to choose if/which one they want to be a part of. <br>

The software is able to cover every country/city you wish to work with - the base country is <i>Bulgaria</i> and its biggest cities - they are in the DB from the start!<br>
